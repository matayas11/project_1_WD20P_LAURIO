                    Izuku Midoriya is a young man who dreams of becoming a Hero despite being bullied by his violent childhood friend Katsuki Bakugo for lacking a Quirk. Both youths idolize one of the world's greatest heroes All Might, who they both met with Izuku being one of few to know of a critical injury All Might has been concealing from the public eye to maintain morale. All Might also reveals the nature of his Quirk "One For All" and passes it down to Izuku to succeed him after seeing the youth's determination in the face of danger. As Izuku begins his path to becoming a hero in attending U.A. High School (雄英高校, Yūei Kōkō) alongside Bakugo and the friends they make in Class 1-A, a nemesis to the "One For All" users named All For One conditions his apprentice Tomura Shigaraki along with League of Villains plan to destroy the current society and its heroes.

            </p>
            <p>
                The students take part and participate in the U.A. Sports Festival, which gives them the opportunity to show off their Quirks and skills to the world. Amongst all the alliances and declarations, Izuku learns about the tragic past of Shoto Todoroki, and manages to help him learn to accept himself for who he is. At the end of the event, Katsuki Bakugo is the winner after defeating Shoto in the final battle. After the Sports Festival, the students take internships where they get to train with Pro Heroes. Izuku trains with All Might's former master, Gran Torino, to gain control over his Quirk. Meanwhile, evil begins moving about in Hosu City, as the Hero Killer: Stain makes a name for himself, eventually leading to a confrontation with the League of Villains and three young heroes seeks out to defeat him, including Tenya Iida who seeks for revenge after his older brother was injured.
            </p>
            <p>
                After Katsuki is captured by the Vanguard Action Squad in summer training camp, the students and teachers of U.A. must deal with the ramifications of their failure. As the Pro Heroes prepare to infiltrate the League of Villains' hideout to rescue him, a brave group of students named The Bakugo Rescue Squad, decide to take matters into their own hands and attempt to rescue their classmate by themselves. This culminates in the arrival of All For One, who after a devastating and hard-hitting battle, is defeated by All Might, at the cost of him losing the remaining embers of One For All, and retiring as a Hero. After All Might's retirement, the U.A. High School transitions into a constructed dorm, where the students currently lives, in order not only to keep them safe but will help to determine the identity of U.A. traitor. The students preparing for their Provisional Hero License Exam, becoming that much closer to full-fledged Heroes. The students of Class 1-A manage to overcome the competition with the other schools. Everyone has passed and getting their licenses, except Todoroki and Bakugo. In the aftermath, Katsuki confronts Izuku Midoriya, revealing he has figured out the truth behind Izuku's Quirk. After the two have a fight, All Might comes clean to Katsuki about the truth behind One For All, and he agrees to keep the secret for them. 
            </p>
             <p>With their licenses, the students are able to take part in Hero Work-Studies, and Izuku seeks out internship with All Might's former sidekick, Sir Nighteye, even though he believes Izuku to be an ill-fated successor for One For All. Meanwhile, Overhaul, the head of the Shie Hassaikai, seeks to bring the yakuza back into prominence, thanks to a Quirk-Destroying Drug they have created using a girl named Eri, even forcing the League of Villains to assist them. After learning about the existence of Eri and the Shie Hassaikai's plans, a team of Pro Heroes, including Izuku and some of his classmates, raid the yakuza's headquarters in attempt to rescue her and stop them. Izuku successfully save Eri and defeat Overhaul in battle, though at the cost of Sir Nighteye's life.
